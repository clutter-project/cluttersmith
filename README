ClutterSmith
------------

A a base for a Clutter authoring environment.

Compile and install as normal, the following dependencies are needed:

gobject-introspection
gir-repository
clutter 
nbtk (the mx branch)
clutter-gst 
gjs

GObject introspection files are expected to have been generated and installed
for mx and clutter. A good way to download the sources needed is to run the
jhbuild bootstrap of gnome-shell.

Further docmentation is contained within the program.
