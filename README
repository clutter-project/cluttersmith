ClutterSmith
============

A a base for a Clutter authoring environment.

ClutterSmith is highly experimental no stability or future backwards
compatibility for the project files is guaranteed. It can currently be used
to create json files for use with any Clutter supported language binding.
The javascript integration with gjs goes beyond what can be statically
decalred in a .json file. It should be possible to also use some javascript
driven features also from other languages.

Building
--------

Compile and install as normal, the following dependencies are needed:

gobject-introspection
gir-repository
clutter 
nbtk (the mx branch)
clutter-gst 
gjs

GObject introspection files are expected to have been generated and installed
for mx and clutter. A good way to download the sources needed is to run the
jhbuild bootstrap of gnome-shell (see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell).

ClutterSmith needs to be installed before it works, it currently launches
in browse mode on a tutorial. Note that the default project is read only
since it is installed in a system location. To edit a project launch
cluttersmith with a working directory or an existing json file as the argument.

Features
--------

This outline is a summary of interactions in cluttersmith, some prefixed
with a - are not implemented yet. This is development planning sheet and not
a user guide, many of the things listed here will probably change. The
actions are organized based on the context where it is possible to perform
these actions.

      -animation triggering  the animations of a scene should be named..
                             (perhaps using named transitions would be good?)


Animation creation
------------------

An animation is a complete state transition for a subset of the scene
graph, going from one state to another. Having implicit state transitions
where the easing mode and target values for each state is defined could also
be desirable and easier to work with. The following ascii art illustrates
the capabilities I think the "complext" animation management needs to
deal with, there is a clutter bug tracking adding such a feature, the
animation described like this should be stored in the .json file of the
scene.

actorA             |
  opacity          | 0.0 -sinc-- 100.0
  x                | ? ----linear------------ 100.0 -- ease-in-out - 200.0
  y                | ? ----linear------------ 80.0 ----- linear ---- 0.0
  rotation-angle-x |           ? ------------------ 360.0  (rots need wrapping.)
actorB
  opacity          | 0.0 ----sinc-------- 100.0 ------------- 100.0
  x                |            ? ----linear------------ 0.0 
  y                |            ? ----linear------------ 0.0
